## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

First we pull the data from personal Github, data was made with excel and uploaded to github as a CSV.

```{r}
Data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sokkarbishoy/DATA607/main/Flights%20wk5.csv")

print(Data)
```

Install packages

in the code below, I installed the packages tidyverse which includes tidyr amd dplyr packages. I started by

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

#code to transform the states columns into a new variale called destination 

Data2 <-Data %>%
  pivot_longer( cols = c('Los.Angeles', 'Phoenix', 'San.Diego', 'San.Francisco', 'Seattle'), names_to = "Destination", values_to = "Frequency")

head(Data2)

```

In the code below I rename the missing columns names with Airline and Status and remove the "." in the states with a space.

```{r}

colnames(Data2)[colnames(Data2) %in% c("X", "X.1")] <- c("Airline", "Status")
head(Data2)

```

```{r}

```

To remove the . between states I used the following code.

```{r}
Data2$Destination <- gsub("\\.", " ", Data2$Destination)

head(Data2)
```

```{r}
str(Data2)
```

```{r}
summary(Data2)
```

```{r}

average_flights <- mean(Data2$Frequency)
average_flights
```

\
We can find the create a ggplot to highlight the destinations and how often they could be delayed.

```{r}
ggplot(Data2, aes(x= Destination, y= Frequency, fill = Status))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  labs(title = "Flights by Destination and Status",
       x = "Destination",
       y = "Flights",
       fill = "Status")
```

To compare the number of flights of both Airlines mentioned and the number of delayed can be presented using the next plot.

It appears that AM west have higher number of flights and more thus more delayed flighthass.

```{r}
ggplot(Data2, aes(x= Airline, y = Frequency, fill = Status))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
